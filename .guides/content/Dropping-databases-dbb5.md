It's time to learn how to get rid of all the data, together with its tables. 

As we mentioned earlier, the `DROP` SQL keyword, part of the SQL _Data Definition Language_ is a very powerful command. Once it has been executed, there is no turning back, unless the necessary backup procedures are made.

We've created a `hostel` database. 
Show the available databases with the `SHOW DATABASES;` statement to confirm the existance of the `hostel` database.

Execute the `DROP DATABASE hostel;` command to see this:

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

And display the available databases again to confirm that the `hostel` database is gone.
